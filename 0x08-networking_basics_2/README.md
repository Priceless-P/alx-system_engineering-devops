# 0x08. Networking basics #1

In this project, I learned networking basics in the context of Linux and Bash scripting. I completed tasks related to configuring IP addresses, displaying active IPv4 IPs, and creating a script to listen on a specific port.

## Tasks

1. [Change your home IP](0-change_your_home_IP)
   - I created a Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server to change the IP resolution of localhost to 127.0.0.2 and facebook.com to 8.8.8.8.
   - It's important to note that reverting localhost to 127.0.0.1 should be done if the script is used on a machine that you plan to continue using.

2. [Show attached IPs](1-show_attached_IPs)
   - I developed a Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IPs on the machine where it is executed.
   - The script provides a list of the active IPv4 IPs on the local machine.

3. [Port listening on localhost](100-port_listening_on_localhost)
   - An advanced task that involved writing a Bash script to listen on port 98 on localhost.t.
   - This script can be useful for debugging network issues, testing software, or working with firewall rules.
