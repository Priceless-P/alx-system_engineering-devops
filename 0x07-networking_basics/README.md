# 0x07. Networking basics #0

In this project, I learned the fundamentals of networking, focusing on key concepts such as the OSI model, types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, UDP and TCP, TCP and UDP ports, and network diagnostics using the ICMP protocol.

## Tasks

1. [OSI model](0-OSI_model)
    - In this task, I explored the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, an abstract model used to describe layered communication and computer network design.
    - I discussed the organization of the OSI model, from the lowest level (Layer 1) to the highest level (Layer 7).
    - I answered questions about the OSI model's purpose and organization.

2. [Types of network](1-types_of_network)
    - This task focuses on different types of networks, such as LAN (Local Area Network) and WAN (Wide Area Network).
    - I answered questions about the types of networks and their use cases.

3. [MAC and IP address](2-MAC_and_IP_address)
    - In this task, I discussed MAC (Media Access Control) addresses and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses.
    - I answered questions related to MAC and IP addresses.

4. [UDP and TCP](3-UDP_and_TCP)
    - This task explained the roles of UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) in network communication.
    - I answered questions about UDP and TCP protocols.

5. [TCP and UDP ports](4-TCP_and_UDP_ports)
    - I created a Bash script that displays listening ports on a network device.
    - The script shows only listening sockets and provides information about the associated program and PID.

6. [Is the host on the network](5-is_the_host_on_the_network)
    - This task involves writing a Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.
    - The script accepts an IP address as an argument and pings it five times to check network connectivity.
