# Task 0: What Happens When...

## Blog Post

I have written a comprehensive blog post explaining the sequence of events that occur when you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter. The post covers various aspects of the web stack, including DNS requests, TCP/IP, firewall, HTTPS/SSL, load balancing, web server, application server, and database.

# Task 1: Everything's Better with a Pretty Diagram

## Diagram

I have added a schema to the blog post, illustrating the flow of the request when typing "https://www.google.com" in the browser and pressing Enter. The diagram includes DNS resolution, server IP and port, encrypted traffic, firewall, load balancer, web server response, application server processing, and database interaction.
